**Web Jargon** is the Google Chrome Browser Extension designed for browsing when a keyboard and mouse are too much to handle. Our plugin uses Google Web Speech Recognition and python text processing libraries in order to control your web browsing experience by voice. Web Jargon has an English web jargon request system designed so that you only have to say a wake word and an action to take pertaining to a certain website element to control, then the API will intelligently discern and extract the correct action(s) to take for you. Web Jargon is the senior project of Shaun Howard and Elliot Essman from Case Western Reserve University for EECS 395 Spring 2016.
